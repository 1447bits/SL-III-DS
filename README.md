## Group A

### Data Wrangling - I, 

#### Perform the following operations using Python on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)
1. Import all the required Python Libraries.
2. Locate open source data from the web (e.g.,https://www.kaggle.com). Provide a clear description of the data and its source (i.e., URL of the web site).
3. Load the Dataset into pandas dataframe.
4. Data Preprocessing: check for missing values in the data using pandas isnull(), describe() function to get some initialstatistics. Provide variable descriptions. Types of variables etc. Check the dimensions of the data frame.
5. Data Formatting and Data Normalization: Summarize the types of variables by checking the data types (i.e., character, numeric, integer, factor, and logical) of the variables in the data set. If variables are not in the correct data type, apply proper type conversions.
6. Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python.

### Data Wrangling - II
#### Create an “Academic performance” dataset of students and perform the following operations using Python.
1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies. If there are missing values and/or inconsistencies, use any of the suitable techniques to deal with them.
2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers. If there are outliers, use any of the suitable techniques to deal with them.
3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables. The purpose of this transformation should be one of the following reasons: to change the scale for better understanding of the variable, to convert a non-linear relation into a linear one, or to decrease the skewness and convert the distribution into a normal distribution.

#### Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency and variability Perform the following operations on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)
1. Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for a dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative (categorical) variables.

For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the age groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical variable.

2. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, standard deviation etc. of the species of ‘Irissetosa’, ‘Iris-versicolor’ and ‘Iris-versicolor’ of iris.csv dataset.

#### Data Analytics I
Create a Linear Regression Model using Python/R to predict home prices using Boston Housing Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). The Boston Housing dataset contains information about various houses in Boston through different parameters. There are 506 samplesand 14 feature variables in this dataset.

#### Data Analytics II
1. Implement logistic regression using Python/R to perform classification on Social_Network_Ads.csv dataset.
2. Compute Confusion matrix to find TP, FP, TN, FN, Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, Recall on the given dataset.
